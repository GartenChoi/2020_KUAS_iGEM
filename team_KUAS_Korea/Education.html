      <h2>2020 Science Day</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Team KUAS opened experiment booth on 2020 Science Day hosted by National Science Museum. This exposition is mainly aimed at teenagers whom are not familiar with synthetic biology and we decided to deliver the exact understanding of it with bio brick board game. Participants could synthesize the organisms as their preferred techniques and could experience achievement of DIY Bio. In addition, we took explanation videoclip about synthetic biology concept with bio brick example cases. Participants could learn the concept of bio brick such as standardization, modularizing process through our appealing education paradigm. Through interchange with teenagers for long period, we noticed the importance of experimental approach to them and intensified it this year.</p>
      <p>On account of COVID-19 situation, this event was progressed on online. Our kits and supplies had delivered to participants beforehand. Henceforth, they get involved with our synthetic biology experiences with prepared videoclip. We received questions through e-mail and respond it within the limits of the possible. After COVID-19 pandemic, we are planning to visit specific schools which engaged in our online science day booth. Additionally, Team KUAS will communicate with them consistently through SNS channel with useful information.</p>

      <h2>SU salon seminar </h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>On Thursday, December 5, 2019, we gave a lecture at SU Salon, organized by TIDE Institute, on the subject of "synthetic biology and iGEM". ‘SingularityU Seoul chapter’ is a Korean Branch of the University of Singularity, a private start-up school located in Silicon Valley in the U.S., and is operated by TIDE Institute, a platform company that discovers and fosters entrepreneurs, makers, and innovators. The TIDE Institute hosts a networking event SU salon every quarter to promote innovative technologies to many people. We has been in contact with Bio lab Seoul, a subsidiary of TIDE Institute, since September 2019, and KUAS has been invited to the networking event as a keynote speaker. In this networking event, we shared our experiences in iGEM and talked about KUAS's 2019 project (Bioluminescent Tattoo for Stress detection), iGEM's winning team, impressive team, and the future of synthetic biology. After seminar, a total of 20 people participated in the survey, and 63% of the respondents said they were satisfied with the content of the lecture, and KUAS was also a meaningful place to communicate directly with the public. We thought that if we could have this kind of communication again in the future, we would like to secure more QnA time and talk more with the public to popularize synthetic biology.</p>
