      <h2>Intro</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>The original intent of this project was to create a thermosensor patch for newborns that can be used when treating neonatal jaundice. However, we thought it necessary to change the course of this project in that we received some negative feedback in an interview with a paediatrician and that many changes were made in society due to the worldwide COVID-19 epidemic.</p>
      <p>At multiple-use public facilities in Korea, body temperature is measured at the entrance with an infrared thermometer, and stickers are distributed to those who have normal body temperature when entering and leaving the facility. The problem was that although multi-use facilities can only be used if the body temperature is normal when enteringthe building, the change in body temperature after entering the building is not known. Therefore, if we change the direction of our project to that of body temperature measuring stickers distributed to people using multi-use facilities, we thought it would be good to be able to monitor body temperature continuously, so we interviewed volunteers who measure body temperature at multi-use facilities.</p>
      <p>We think this project can be used not only in the current pandemic situation, but also in various ways, such as those who do not like the contact method of body temperature measurement, and children who are afraid with measuring body temperature using equipment.</p>

      <h2>A pediatrician’s thoughts about the application of our RNA aptamer-based thermo-sensor on monitoring body temperature of jaundice patients.</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Intro: Since our thermo-sensor requires an ambient light source of a certain wavelength, we thought that our project is applicable for jaundice patients receiving phototherapy. Our hypothesis is that we could produce thermo sensors in a part of sticker which would be applied to the patient’s skin. In case of an patient’s abnormal body temperature, our aptamers will light up instantly. We would like to hear your opinion on our application.</p>
      <p><b>Q1: First, could you briefly tell us about the symptoms of jaundice and how treatment is done?</b></p>
      <p>A1: Jaundice is caused by accumulation of bilirubin in the infant patient’s body. Premature infants are more vulnerable to this disease since they don’t have a well-established BBB. They could experience choreoathetoid movement, a type of a seizure, and if they are left untreated, it could lead to irreversible neurological disorders. Visible symptoms include yellowness of the skin which can be diagnosed by a bilirubin sensor which measures how yellow the skin is. Though monitoring is crucial for infants, fever is not one of it’s symptoms.</p>
      <p>Treatment is done by exposing the patient to blue light at the incubator. Since premature infants are vulnerable to the lowering of body temperature, they are attached to a digital thermometer which constantly monitors the infant’s body temperature. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>Q2: Do you think our project is suitable for this purpose? Any advice on how our project should improve to suit this application?</b></p>
      <p>A2: I think that the main problem is that, as mentioned before, there already is a reliable product that constantly monitors the infant’s body temperature. I think it would be very difficult for your project to replace digital thermometers simply because they are so advanced. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Monitoring body temperature is critical for premature infant patients. It is a matter of life and death. So, the most important thing is that your project has to be reliable. It must quickly and accurately light-up when abnormalities are detected. If this is no achievable, I rather recommend you to apply this project to mature infants since they are not as vulnerable as premature infants to variations in body temperature. </p>
      <p>After this interview, we decided to seek another suitable direction for our project.</p>

      <h2>사회봉사단 인터뷰</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><b>Q1. How does Korea University deals with the COVID-19 situation?</b></p>
      <p>A1. Every student entering the building are stopped at the entrance and required to have their temperatures checked. We usually do it with infrared cameras. Students with temperature above 37.5℃ are set aside for a moment and are rechecked after 3-5 minutes, since it may be due to hot weather. We also use forehead thermometer the second time we check because forehead thermometers are considered more accurate than infrared cameras. If the student still has temperature above 37.5℃, he or she isn’t permitted in to the building and immediately asked to leave.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>Q2. What are some problems of the current way of temperature checking?</b></p>
      <p>A2. The biggest problem is inaccuracy and the lack of reliability of infrared cameras. Also, people’s normal body temperature varies on their own. With infrared camera, the range is about 32~40℃. For these two reasons, we had to check people multiple times which is pretty inconvenient.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>Q3. Do you feel necessity of continuous observation on body temperature alteration?</b></p>
      <p>A3. It’s crucial to ensure the definition of continuous observation regarding how long does it takes and frequency of itself. I sympathize with its strong necessity, meanwhile this team need to get advice on measurement interval and period from experts.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>Q4. What is your opinion about our progressed project and future direction?</b></p>
      <p>A4. The existing thermal camera gets too much impact by external environment such as weather or body temperature. In this context, body-attachable temperature measuring equipment will improve the accuracy significantly. This team must resolve current problem regarding invisible luminescence of stickers. Then it would be the supreme way that makes temperature measuring easier with instant identification.</p>

      <h2>Biosafety Interview with Professor Lee Sang-pal</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <blockquote>
        <i class="icofont-quote-left"></i>
        Biosafety's primary goal is to produce safe products that are not hazardous to human health and health care, and to ensure that laboratory researchers, developers and other related personnel are not exposed to danger during the production process of such products. In other words, the aim is to pursue comprehensive safety.
        <i class="icofont-quote-right"></i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>On Thursday, September 24th, 2020, we conducted an online meeting with Professor Lee Sang-pal of the Graduate School of Science and Technology Policy at Hanyang University on the theme of Biosafety. We briefed Professor Lee Sang-pal on our project and asked for advice on KUAS' activities.</p>
      <p>The project uses artificially synthesized genetic materials such as RNA and DNA, but they do not seem to violate current bioethics or safety laws (although further consideration is needed because they may be provided for in other laws).</p>
      <p>The Bioethics and Safety Acts prevents human and human materials from being researched, and prevents human dignity and value from being hazarded when dealing with embryonic genes. He said that human materials are defined as ”blood clots, plasma chromosome, DNA(Deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA(Ribonucleic acid), proteins, etc.”(Article2 of the Act). Instead, we received the opinion that in order to commercialize and use our project, we need to examine the laws on pharmaceutical safety in more detail (e.g., Act on testing and inspection in the food and drug industry and Regulation on drug safety, etc.).</p>
      <p>He also said the Korean public is unfamiliar with molecular biology and needs to make efforts to raise social awareness. Regarding this, he advised that our KUAS team should correct this and play a role in supporting communication. We received an opinion that it is necessary to create videos with easy-to-understand knowledge of molecular biology, synthetic biology, and Biosafety, to improve the understanding and awareness of the general public through templates, and to share them on SNS. In the future, we thought that it would be necessary for our team to make an effort to actively provide the importance of molecular biology and sound information such as biosafety.</p>
