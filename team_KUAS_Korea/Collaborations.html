      <h2>KSA</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>On August 18th, 2020, Team KUAS had academic conference with our new collaboration group named KSA. We had steady online conversation regarding ecofriendly material and synthetic biological countermeasure toward COVID-19 from before the meeting. Team KSA had eco-friendly development of paper through removal of ‘Lignin’ with genetically Engineered Bacteria application as their main interest this year. We discussed experimental method with biological insight over and proponed new method such as agarose gel electrophoresis.</p>
      <p>Their research was aimed at not only water waste minimization & eco-friendly material development, but also epoch-making improvement of paper industry production paradigm. We offered counsel about human practice direction such as interviewing field workers or effective online education approach for elementary schoolchildren.</p>
      <p>By reason of their restricted high schooler status, we compromised vigorous partnership vision, not by temporary interchange. We instructed the knowledges like enzymes involved in Lignin Degradation and they offered us new angle about usage of our temperature measurement. In spite of their young age, it was very precious encounter with more learnings and we promised to get together on experiment management.</p>

      <h2>SIS</h2>

    <div>
      <p>KUAS had collaboration with Korean high school team named SIS this year. We had mutual discussion session about concerns of each other’s topic. The team SIS had big interest in how to acquiring food security more efficiently than before. SIS had mainly focused on developing countries especially Sri Lanka which suffer from malnutrition in 25 districts. The reason they chose this topic was that the country’s rice production was enough for their population but its loss in storage was too large.</p>
      <p>After we shared our topic each other, we gave them an advice and answered some possible errors. We also presented a guideline for their dry lab activities, and suggested various programs for human practice activities. It was very meaningful time to get insight about synthetic biology. </p>
      <p>Through this collaboration, we could share our understandings and views on iGEM and have a chance to look back on our project.</p>
