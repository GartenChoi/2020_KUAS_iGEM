        Biosafety's primary goal is to produce safe products that are not hazardous to human health and health care, also to ensure that laboratory researchers, developers with other related personnel are not exposed to danger during the production process of such products. In other words, the aim is to pursue comprehensive safety.

      <p>On Thursday, September 24th, 2020, we conducted an online meeting with Professor Lee Sang-pal of the Graduate School of Science and Technology Policy at Hanyang University on the theme of Biosafety. We briefed Professor Lee Sang-pal on our project and asked for advice on KUAS' activities.</p>
      <p>The project uses artificially synthesized genetic materials such as RNA and DNA, but they do not seem to violate current bioethics or safety laws (although further consideration is needed because they may be provided for in other laws).</p>
      <p>The Bioethics and Safety Acts prevents human and human materials from being researched, and prevents human dignity and value from being hazarded when dealing with embryonic genes. He said that human materials are defined as ”blood clots, plasma chromosome, DNA(Deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA(Ribonucleic acid), proteins, etc.”(Article2 of the Act). Instead, we received the opinion that in order to commercialize and use our project, we need to examine the laws on pharmaceutical safety in more detail (e.g., Act on testing and inspection in the food and drug industry and Regulation on drug safety, etc.).</p>
